# Modsets

Some predefined modsets.

I was hesitant to put them in here and hereby forcing my preference and selection of mods into defining "The SOS Standard Modsetâ„¢". There will always be differences, personal preferences may vary - so this is just a suggestion.

## The Minimal Modset

## Improved Immersion
